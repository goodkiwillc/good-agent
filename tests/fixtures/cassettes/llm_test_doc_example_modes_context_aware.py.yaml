        here are some of the most popular frameworks, each with its strengths:\\n\\n-
        **TensorFlow**: Developed by Google, it's highly scalable and great for production
        environments. It supports both research and deployment, with tools like TensorFlow
        Lite for mobile and TensorFlow Serving for production.\\n\\n- **PyTorch**:
        Favored in the research community for its dynamic computation graph and ease
        of use. It\u2019s excellent for experimentation and prototyping, and it\u2019s
        increasingly being adopted in production as well.\\n\\n- **scikit-learn**:
        Ideal for traditional machine learning tasks like classification, regression,
        and clustering. It\u2019s user-friendly and great for beginners or projects
        that don\u2019t require deep learning.\\n\\n- **Keras**: Originally a high-level
        API for TensorFlow, it simplifies building neural networks and is great for
        beginners and rapid development.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re starting out or focusing
        on deep learning research, PyTorch is often recommended. For deploying models
        at scale, TensorFlow might be more suitable. What kind of AI project are you
        thinking about? That can help narrow down the best framework for you.\",\n
