  <!-- Mustache (The Swanson) -->
  <!-- A thick, authoritative shape. Stroke changed to white to pop against dark BG? 
       Wait, mustache is ON the face (#E0E0E0). 
       The original stroke was dark (#2D2D2D) to define it against the face. 
       If I make the mustache stroke WHITE, it might look weird on the light face.
       BUT the user said "brown border... isn't very visible against dark background".
       Actually, the mustache is INSIDE the robot face. The robot face is light grey.
       So the mustache stroke doesn't need to change for background contrast, it needs to contrast with the FACE.
       
       Wait. If the logo is transparent, and the robot head is filled with #E0E0E0, 
       then the mustache is sitting on #E0E0E0.
       So the Dark Mode of the website is behind the robot.
       The problem "detail of the logo gets lost... brown border" implies the *edge of the robot* against the background.
       OR the user thinks the mustache is the border?
       
       Let's assume the user means the outer border of the robot.
       The internal features (mustache, eyes) are on the light face, so they don't need changing.
       So I will ONLY change the Outer Head Rect stroke and Antenna stroke to White/Light.
       I will KEEP the mustache stroke dark (#2D2D2D) because it sits on the light face.
