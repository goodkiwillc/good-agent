# Good Agent Style Guide

**"Aggressively Adequate"**

This document outlines the visual and tonal standards for the Good Agent project. Our aesthetic is inspired by mid-century bureaucracy, municipal utility providers, and Ron Swanson's "Very Good Building & Development Co."

## 1. Brand Voice

- **Tone:** Deadpan, Stoic, Reliable, Concise.
- **What we are:** A library that works.
- **What we are NOT:** "Delightful", "Magic", "Ninja", or "Rockstar".
- **Keywords:** Functional, Standard, Compliant, Durable.

**Example:**
> *Bad:* "🚀 Blast off with our super-charged agent engine! It's magic! ✨"
> *Good:* "The agent execution engine functions as intended. It processes tasks."

## 2. Visual Identity

### The Logo: "Bureaucrat Bot"
A square, grey robot with a mustache. It represents the unenthusiastic competence of the software.
